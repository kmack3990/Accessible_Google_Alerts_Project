# Accessible_Google_Alerts_Project
This was the presentation that we created as a team of two data scientists, two webX designers, and two web developers in a 24 hour hackathon with Google. 

We developed a more accessible Google Alerts prototype for users that have visual impairment. Enjoy the presentation!
